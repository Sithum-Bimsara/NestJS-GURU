    "We assume you already:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Installed **Node.js** and **npm**.\n",
    "* Installed **NestJS CLI** globally using:\n",

    "## 1. Using `nest --help` to Explore CLI Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS/Linux).\n",
    "2. Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   nest --help\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. You should see output like:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * General usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * `Usage: nest <command> [options]`\n",
    "   * Options:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * `-v, --version` → show Nest CLI version.\n",
    "     * `-h, --help` → show help.\n",
    "   * Important commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * `new | n` → Generate a new Nest application.\n",
    "     * `build` → Build Nest application.\n",
    "     * `start` → Run Nest application.\n",
    "     * `info | i` → Show Nest project details.\n",

    "## 2. Planning Where to Create the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, if you run `nest new <project-name>` from your **user directory**, it will create the project there.\n",
    "\n",
    "But usually, you want a **specific folder** for all your NestJS projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to your **Desktop**.\n",
    "2. Create a folder, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `nestjs-course`\n",
    "3. Inside this folder, you’ll store all projects for the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Navigating to the Folder Using `cd`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In **Command Prompt / Terminal**, move into your course folder using `cd` (change directory):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd <path-to-your-folder>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example (Windows):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\nestjs-course\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After this, your terminal is “inside” that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Any new NestJS project you create will be created **inside this directory**.\n",

    "## 4. Creating a New NestJS Project with `nest new`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we create our **first project**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command\n",
    "\n",
    "From inside your chosen folder, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nest new 1-nest-js-intro\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `nest` → Nest CLI.\n",
    "* `new` → command to create a new application.\n",
    "* `1-nest-js-intro` → project name (will also be the folder name).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package manager selection\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the command, CLI will ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Which package manager would you ❤️  to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Options usually are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `npm`\n",
    "* `yarn`\n",
    "* `pnpm`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Up/Down arrow keys** to select one and press **Enter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `npm` was selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nest CLI will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a new folder** with the project name (e.g. `1-nest-js-intro`).\n",
    "2. Inside that folder, it will **generate files and folders**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `.prettierrc`\n",
    "   * `eslint.config.mjs`\n",
    "   * `nest-cli.json`\n",
    "   * `package.json`\n",
    "   * `README.md`\n",
    "   * `tsconfig.json`\n",
    "   * `tsconfig.build.json`\n",
    "   * `src/` folder (contains `app.controller.ts`, `app.service.ts`, `app.module.ts`, `main.ts`)\n",
    "   * `test/` folder (for e2e tests)\n",
    "3. Then it will **install required packages** using the selected package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "✨  We will scaffold your app in a few seconds..\n",

    "$ npm run start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## 5. Opening the Project in VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s open the generated project in **Visual Studio Code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **VS Code**.\n",
    "2. Click **“Open Folder”**.\n",
    "3. Navigate to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `Desktop` → `nestjs-course` → `1-nest-js-intro` (or your path).\n",
    "4. Select the `1-nest-js-intro` folder and click **“Select Folder”**.\n",
    "5. If prompted, click **“Yes, I trust the authors”**.\n",

    "  * `\"build\"` → builds (compiles) the Nest project.\n",
    "  * `\"start\"` → compiles and runs the app once.\n",
    "  * `\"start:dev\"` → runs the app in **watch mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is “watch mode”?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Watch mode** automatically recompiles your app whenever you **change and save** a file.\n",
    "* This is very useful during development.\n",
    "* `start:dev` script typically runs something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  nest start --watch\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `\"start\"` for a simple run.\n",
    "* Use `\"start:dev\"` during development so you don’t have to manually recompile every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Running the Project with `npm run start:dev`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now **start the NestJS server** in watch mode.\n",

    "### Step 2 – Run the dev script\n",
    "\n",
    "Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm run start:dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `npm run` → runs a script defined in `package.json`.\n",
    "* `start:dev` → the script name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you’ll see in the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "* It will **compile** your NestJS app.\n",
    "* It will say something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `Starting compilation in watch mode...`\n",
    "  * `Found 0 errors. Watching for file changes.`\n",
    "  * `Nest application successfully started`\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that the app is running, let’s open it in a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 – Which port is it running on?\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a new NestJS app listens on **port 3000**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In VS Code, go to `src/main.ts`.\n",
    "2. You’ll see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```ts\n",
    "   await app.listen(3000);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. This means the app is listening on **port 3000**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 – Open in browser\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).\n",
    "2. Type this URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   http://localhost:3000\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Press **Enter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Hello World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **default response** from the new NestJS app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Where Does “Hello World” Come From?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s trace how NestJS returns the `Hello World` text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.1 `main.ts` – Entry Point\n",
    "\n",
    "* File: `src/main.ts`\n",
    "* This is the **entry point** of every NestJS application.\n",
    "* It does things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Create the Nest application.\n",
    "  * Tell it to listen on port `3000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `npm run start:dev`, NestJS starts here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.2 `app.controller.ts` – Main Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "* File: `src/app.controller.ts`\n",
    "* This file defines the **main controller**.\n",
    "* Inside it, you’ll see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```ts\n",
    "  @Controller()\n",
    "  export class AppController {\n",
    "    constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}\n",
    "\n",
    "    @Get()\n",
    "    getHello(): string {\n",
    "      return this.appService.getHello();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@Controller()` → marks this class as a controller.\n",
    "* `@Get()` → handles **GET requests** to the root path `/`.\n",
    "* `getHello()` → method that handles that request.\n",
    "* It calls `this.appService.getHello()` to get the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.3 `app.service.ts` – Main Service\n",
    "\n",
    "* File: `src/app.service.ts`\n",
    "* This file defines the **service** that contains the logic for `getHello`.\n",
    "* It usually looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```ts\n",
    "  @Injectable()\n",
    "  export class AppService {\n",
    "    getHello(): string {\n",
    "      return 'Hello World!';\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@Injectable()` → marks this class as a **provider** that can be injected.\n",
    "* `getHello()` → returns the string `'Hello World!'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.4 Request → Response Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You go to `http://localhost:3000` in the browser.\n",
    "2. Browser sends a **GET request** to `/` on port `3000`.\n",
    "3. NestJS receives the request and routes it to **`AppController.getHello()`**.\n",
    "4. `getHello()` calls **`AppService.getHello()`**.\n",
    "5. `AppService.getHello()` returns `'Hello World!'`.\n",
    "6. NestJS sends `'Hello World!'` back as the HTTP response.\n",
    "7. Browser displays **Hello World**.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s your **first working NestJS endpoint**! 🎉\n",

    "* The NestJS app you created is a **server-side application**.\n",
    "* When you type `http://localhost:3000`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Your browser **acts as a client**.\n",
    "  * It sends a **request** to your NestJS **server**.\n",
    "  * The server processes the request and sends a **response** (the text \"Hello World\").\n",
