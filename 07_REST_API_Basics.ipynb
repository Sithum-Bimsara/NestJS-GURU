    "## 1. What is a REST API?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **REST** = **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer.\n",
    "* It is a **software architectural style** that defines how **clients** (web browsers, mobile apps, other servers) interact with a **server** to **retrieve and manipulate data**.\n",
    "* It is very popular because of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Simplicity**\n",
    "  * **Scalability**\n",
    "  * **Flexibility**\n",
    "* **APIs can be of different types**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * An API is called a **REST API** only if it **follows the REST principles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. When is an API a “REST API”?\n",
    "\n",
    "An API is considered a REST API when it conforms to the **REST architectural constraints/principles**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Client–Server Architecture** ✅ (mandatory)\n",
    "2. **Stateless** ✅ (mandatory)\n",
    "3. **Cacheable** ✅ (mandatory)\n",
    "4. **Layered System** ✅ (mandatory)\n",
    "5. **Uniform Interface** ✅ (mandatory)\n",
    "6. **Code on Demand** (optional) 🔁\n",
    "\n",
    "> For an API to be truly *RESTful*, the first **five** must be followed. **Code on Demand** is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. REST Principle 1 – Client–Server Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "* A REST API application always follows **client–server** architecture.\n",
    "* There are two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Client** – sends requests (e.g., browser, mobile app, Postman).\n",
    "  * **Server** – receives the request, processes it, and sends back a response.\n",
    "* Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Client** sends an HTTP request to the **API** (hosted on a server).\n",
    "  2. **Server/API** processes the request (validations, DB queries, etc.).\n",
    "  3. **Server** returns an HTTP response back to the **client**.\n",
    "* This separation allows the client UI and the server logic to evolve **independently**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. REST Principle 2 – Stateless\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stateless** means:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Each HTTP request is **independent**.\n",
    "  * The **server does not store any session state** between requests.\n",
    "* Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Every request must contain all the information** the server needs to understand and process it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example – Protected Resource (User Details)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose you want to call an endpoint to get user details: e.g., `/users/me`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You must be an **authenticated user**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In a stateless REST API:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The server **does NOT** store your login session like `userId` in memory.\n",
    "  * Instead, **every request** to a protected resource must include something like an **authentication token** (e.g., JWT) in the request (usually in headers).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Client logs in and receives an **auth token**.\n",
    "  2. Client calls a protected endpoint like `/users/me` and sends the **token with the request**.\n",
    "  3. Server reads and verifies the token:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * If **valid** → respond with user details.\n",
    "     * If **invalid or expired** → respond with an error (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).\n",
    "  4. The server **doesn’t store** this token or user session internally between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key idea:**\n",
    "> No session data is stored on the server.\n",
    "> All required info (like auth token) travels **with each request**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. REST Principle 3 – Cacheability\n",
    "\n",
    "* REST responses can be **cached** to improve performance.\n",
    "* Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Client requests: `GET /users`\n",
    "  * Server responds with a list of (say) **1000 users**.\n",
    "  * Next time, the client makes the **same request**.\n",
    "* Instead of hitting the server again and again for the same data:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The **client** or **intermediate caches** can store that response.\n",
    "  * On repeated requests for the same resource, the data can be served from **cache**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduces **server load**.\n",
    "* Improves **response time** and overall **user experience**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> REST APIs should be **designed to allow caching** where appropriate (using correct cache headers, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. REST Principle 4 – Layered System\n",
    "\n",
    "* REST allows a **layered architecture**.\n",
    "* The client **does not know** how many layers the request passes through.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Layers on the Server Side\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API Gateway / Reverse Proxy**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Middlewares** (authentication, logging, validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cache layer** (e.g., Redis)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Application logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Database**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the client sends a request:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It may pass through multiple layers before reaching the final handler.\n",
    "  * The client still sees a **single uniform API endpoint**.\n",
    "  * The client does not care **how many internal layers** process the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key idea:** The system is organized in layers, but this complexity is **hidden from the client**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. REST Principle 5 – Uniform Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "* REST uses a **uniform interface** between client and server.\n",
    "* It relies on **standard HTTP methods (verbs)** to perform operations on **resources**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Resources & Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **resource**: A thing or collection, e.g. `users`, `products`, `orders`.\n",
    "* A **URL/endpoint** identifies the resource, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `GET http://localhost:3000/users`\n",
    "\n",
    "A request has **two main parts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HTTP Method (Verb)** – what action we want to perform.\n",
    "2. **Endpoint (URL)** – which resource we’re targeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Same Endpoint, Different Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Example resource: `/users`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Get all users**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `GET http://localhost:3000/users`\n",
    "* **Create a new user**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `POST http://localhost:3000/users`\n",
    "* **Delete all users** (not common but possible):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `DELETE http://localhost:3000/users`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Notice: The **URL is the same**.\n",
    "> Only the **HTTP method changes**, and therefore the **action** changes.\n",
    "> This is what **uniform interface** means.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Common HTTP Methods (Verbs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 GET\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose**: Retrieve data from the server.\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Get all users → `GET /users`\n",
    "  * Get a single user by ID → `GET /users/{id}`\n",
    "  * Get all products → `GET /products`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 POST\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose**: Create a new resource on the server.\n",
    "* Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Send a **POST** request to an endpoint with a **request body**.\n",
    "  * Body contains data needed to create the resource.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `POST /products` with body `{ name, price, description }`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3 PUT vs PATCH\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both are used to **update existing resources**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PUT\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Full update**.\n",
    "* You send the **entire object** in the request body, even if only one field changed.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Update product → `PUT /products/{id}`\n",
    "  * Body must contain the whole product object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PATCH\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Partial update**.\n",
    "* You send only the **fields you want to change**.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Just change the `color` of a product → `PATCH /products/{id}`\n",
    "  * Body could be `{ \"color\": \"blue\" }` only.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.4 DELETE\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose**: Delete a resource on the server.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Delete product with ID 5 → `DELETE /products/5`\n",
    "\n",
    "> These five (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) are the **most commonly used** HTTP verbs in REST APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. REST Principle 6 – Code on Demand (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is an **optional** REST constraint.\n",
    "* It allows the server to send **executable code** to the client which the client can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: Downloading a script or some logic dynamically.\n",
    "* This can extend client functionality **without a full app update**.\n",
    "* In practice, this is **not used often** in typical API design, so we usually **ignore it** in backend courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Anatomy of an HTTP Request (Summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we call an API, the request generally contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **HTTP Method** (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, …)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Endpoint (URL)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Domain**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * e.g. `http://localhost:3000`, `https://google.com`, `https://facebook.com`\n",
    "   * **Route / Resource**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * e.g. `/customers`, `/users`, `/posts`, `/products`\n",
    "   * **Route Parameters (Path Parameters)** – dynamic parts in the path\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Example: `/customers/india`\n",
    "\n",
    "       * `customers` → route\n",
    "       * `india` → **route parameter** (can also be `usa`, `uk`, `sri-lanka`, etc.)\n",
    "   * **Query Strings (Query Parameters)** – extra info added after `?`\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Example: `/customers/india?page=2&limit=10`\n",
    "     * Used for filtering, pagination, sorting, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Request Body** (only for some methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Used mainly with **POST**, **PUT**, and **PATCH**.\n",
    "   * Contains the actual **data** to create or update a resource.\n",
    "   * Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Creating a user → `POST /users` with body `{ name, email, password }`.\n",
    "     * Updating a product → `PATCH /products/10` with body `{ price: 999 }`.\n",
    "   * **GET** and **DELETE** usually **do not** have a request body.\n",
