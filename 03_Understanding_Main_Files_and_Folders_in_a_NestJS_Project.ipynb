    "# 03_Understanding_Main_Files_and_Folders_in_a_NestJS_Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going deeper into building features, it’s very important to understand the **main files and folders** that NestJS generates for you. This gives you a clear idea of **where things live** and **what each file does**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this note, we’ll clearly cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `package.json`\n",
    "* `tsconfig.json`\n",
    "* `.gitignore`\n",
    "* `nest-cli.json`\n",
    "* Root-level helper/config files\n",
    "* `dist` folder\n",
    "* `node_modules` folder\n",
    "* `test` folder\n",
    "* `src` folder (and the key files inside it)\n",

    "## 1. `package.json` – The Heart of Any Node/Nest Project\n",
    "\n",
    "`package.json` is the **most important file** of any Node.js project, including NestJS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since **NestJS is built on top of Node.js**, the `package.json` file is also the heart of every NestJS project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does `package.json` contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "It stores **metadata and configuration** about your project, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Basic info**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `name` → project name\n",
    "  * `version` → project version\n",
    "  * `description` → short description\n",
    "  * `author` → who created it\n",
    "  * `license` → license type\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scripts** → for common tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Starting the development server\n",
    "  * Running tests\n",
    "  * Building the project\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scripts you’ll see in a NestJS project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"build\"` → builds (compiles) your NestJS project\n",
    "* `\"start\"` → starts the app (typically compiled JS from `dist`)\n",
    "* `\"start:dev\"` → starts the app in **watch mode** (auto-recompile on changes)\n",
    "* `\"start:debug\"` → starts the app in **debug + watch mode**\n",
    "* `\"start:prod\"` → runs the app from the **compiled output** in the `dist` folder\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** When TypeScript is compiled, the JavaScript output goes to the `dist` folder. Scripts like `start:prod` execute that JavaScript from `dist`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dependencies** (`dependencies`)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Lists **runtime dependencies** (libraries required for the app to run).\n",
    "  * Example for a basic NestJS app:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `@nestjs/common`\n",
    "    * `@nestjs/core`\n",
    "    * `@nestjs/platform-express`\n",
    "    * `rxjs`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dev Dependencies** (`devDependencies`)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Libraries/tools needed **only during development**, not in production runtime.\n",
    "  * Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `@nestjs/cli`\n",
    "    * `@nestjs/testing`\n",
    "    * `eslint`\n",
    "    * `eslint-config` files\n",
    "    * `prettier`\n",
    "\n",
    "> These dev dependencies help with **tooling**, **linting**, **formatting**, and **testing**. They are not required when simply running the built application.\n",
    "\n",
    "So overall, `package.json` stores **all important information** about your NestJS project: metadata, scripts, dependencies, and dev tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. `tsconfig.json` – TypeScript Compiler Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "`tsconfig.json` is a **configuration file for the TypeScript compiler**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It tells TypeScript **how to compile** your `.ts` files into `.js`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical things configured here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`target`** → Which JavaScript version to compile to (e.g., `ES2017`, `ES2020`).\n",
    "* **`module`** → Which module system to use (e.g., `commonjs`).\n",
    "* **`outDir`** → Where the compiled JavaScript should go (usually `\"dist\"`).\n",
    "* Other settings like `strict`, `moduleResolution`, `baseUrl`, `paths`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In short: `tsconfig.json` = instructions for TypeScript on **what to output and how** when compiling your NestJS app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. `.gitignore` – Excluding Files from Git\n",
    "\n",
    "`.gitignore` tells **Git** which files and folders it should **ignore**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* It keeps your **repository clean**.\n",
    "* It avoids committing:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Build artifacts (like compiled JS in `dist`)\n",
    "  * `node_modules` (huge folder, can be re-installed via `npm install`)\n",
    "  * Sensitive files\n",
    "  * Logs and temporary files\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of what `.gitignore` might contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `node_modules/`\n",
    "* `dist/`\n",
    "* `.env`\n",
    "* `*.log`\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is not specific to NestJS, but every serious Node/Nest project should use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. `nest-cli.json` – Nest CLI Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "`nest-cli.json` is **specific to NestJS projects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It configures options for the **Nest CLI**, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which is the **default application**.\n",
    "* Where the **source root** is.\n",
    "* Generator options (how `nest g` commands behave).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of `nest-cli.json` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Configuration file for how Nest CLI should handle this project.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLI reads this file when you use commands like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `nest generate controller ...`\n",
    "* `nest generate service ...`\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Other Root-Level Config Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project root, you may also see files like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `eslint` config (e.g., `eslint.config.mjs` or `.eslintrc.js`)\n",
    "* `.prettierrc`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linting configuration** (ESLint) → helps maintain code style & catch errors.\n",
    "* **Formatting configuration** (Prettier) → auto-formats code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For now, you don’t need to worry too much about them. They are there to improve **code quality and formatting**, but don’t affect core NestJS concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. `dist` Folder – Compiled JavaScript Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dist` folder is where **compiled JavaScript files** are stored **after building your NestJS project**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You write code in **TypeScript** (`.ts` files) under the `src` folder.\n",
    "2. When you **build** or **run** the project, the TypeScript compiler generates `.js` files.\n",
    "3. These `.js` files are placed in the `dist` folder, mirroring the structure of `src`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `src/app.module.ts` → compiles to `dist/app.module.js`\n",
    "* `src/app.controller.ts` → compiles to `dist/app.controller.js`\n",
    "\n",
    "> When running in production (e.g., `npm run start:prod`), Nest will execute the JavaScript inside `dist`, not the original TypeScript files.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`src`** → where you write TypeScript.\n",
    "* **`dist`** → where compiled JavaScript goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. `node_modules` – Installed Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "`node_modules` is a folder that stores **all installed packages** and their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Created when you run `npm install` or when Nest initial setup finishes.\n",
    "* Contains everything listed in `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in `package.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You normally **should not**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manually edit anything in `node_modules`.\n",
    "* Commit this folder to Git (it’s usually in `.gitignore`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If deleted, you can always re-create it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. `test` Folder – Unit & Integration Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The `test` folder is where NestJS puts **starter test files** for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This folder contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unit tests\n",
    "* Integration / e2e tests\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `test/app.e2e-spec.ts`\n",
    "* `test/jest-e2e.json`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start writing tests for your NestJS app, you’ll typically place them here.\n",

    "This is where you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spend **most of your time** as a developer.\n",
    "* Write all the **application logic**.\n",

    "* **Imports** other modules.\n",
    "* **Declares** controllers and providers (services).\n",
    "* Acts as the **main blueprint** of your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of `AppModule` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “The central module that wires together the major building blocks of your NestJS application.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, you will create more modules (e.g., `UsersModule`, `AuthModule`) and import them into `AppModule`.\n",

    "\n",
    "`app.controller.ts` defines the **main controller** of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a controller?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **controller** handles **incoming requests** and **returns responses**.\n",
    "* Since NestJS is typically used for building **server-side applications**, controllers are the place where HTTP requests first arrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fresh project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The default controller usually has a method like `getHello()`.\n",
    "* It is decorated with `@Get()` to handle **GET** requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When a request comes to the server (e.g., `GET /`), it is handled by **`AppController`**.\n",
    "* The `getHello()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Receives the request.\n",
    "  * Delegates work to `AppService`.\n",
    "  * Returns the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you can think of `AppController` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “The main entry point for HTTP requests in the default NestJS app. It receives requests and returns responses.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, as your app grows:\n",

    "\n",
    "`main.ts` is the **entry point** of your NestJS application.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it do?\n",
    "\n",
    "* It **bootstraps the application**.\n",
    "* It tells NestJS to start the app using a specific module (usually `AppModule`).\n",
    "* It starts the **HTTP server** and makes it listen on a certain port (e.g., `3000`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms:\n",

    "So the flow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `main.ts` boots the app and listens on port 3000.\n",
