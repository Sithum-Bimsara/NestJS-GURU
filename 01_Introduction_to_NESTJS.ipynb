    "## 1. What is NestJS?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NestJS** is a **robust and scalable Node.js framework** for building **server-side (backend) applications**.\n",
    "* It is **built on top of Node.js** and uses **TypeScript** as its main programming language.\n",
    "* NestJS is especially good for creating **efficient**, **maintainable**, and **well-structured** backend apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Framework type**: Server-side application framework for Node.js.\n",
    "* **Main language**: TypeScript (but it ultimately runs as JavaScript).\n",
    "* **Target**: Small apps, large enterprise apps, and even microservices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. NestJS and TypeScript\n",
    "\n",
    "* NestJS is **built with TypeScript in mind**.\n",
    "* TypeScript provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Strong type safety** → fewer runtime errors.\n",
    "  * **Better code completion & IntelliSense** in IDEs.\n",
    "  * **Improved code quality** and easier refactoring.\n",
    "* Important:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We **write code in TypeScript**.\n",
    "  * The TypeScript code is **compiled (transpiled) to JavaScript**.\n",
    "  * The **Node.js runtime executes the compiled JavaScript** on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the flow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You write **NestJS code in TypeScript**.\n",
    "2. TypeScript compiler → converts TS → JS.\n",
    "3. **Node.js** runs the generated JS on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. NestJS and Node.js / Express / Fastify\n",
    "\n",
    "* NestJS is built **on top of Node.js**.\n",
    "* Under the hood, it uses an **HTTP server framework**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **By default**: NestJS uses **Express**.\n",
    "  * Optionally: You can switch to **Fastify** instead of Express.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can choose between:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `Express` (default, very popular ecosystem)\n",
    "  * `Fastify` (faster in many cases, modern design)\n",
    "* NestJS **integrates seamlessly with other Node.js libraries and frameworks**, so you can still use the Node ecosystem you already know.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Architecture & Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "NestJS is designed to be **highly structured**. It follows key principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "* NestJS uses a **modular architecture**.\n",
    "* Your app is divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Modules** – logical grouping of related code (features).\n",
    "  * **Controllers** – handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses.\n",
    "  * **Services** – contain business logic.\n",
    "  * **Providers** – any class that can be injected as a dependency (services, repositories, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of modularity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clear **separation of concerns**.\n",
    "* Better **readability**.\n",
    "* Easier **maintainability**.\n",
    "* Easier **testability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Dependency Injection (DI)\n",
    "\n",
    "* NestJS has **built-in dependency injection**.\n",
    "* This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Instead of creating objects manually inside classes, NestJS **injects dependencies** for you.\n",
    "  * Helps you **manage dependencies** cleanly.\n",
    "  * Makes **unit testing** easier (you can inject mocks).\n",
    "  * Promotes **loose coupling** between components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Why NestJS is a Good Choice (Features & Advantages)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 TypeScript-first\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built with **TypeScript** from the start.\n",
    "* Strong typing → fewer bugs.\n",
    "* Better autocompletion and refactoring support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Modular structure\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code is split into **modules, controllers, services, providers**.\n",
    "* This promotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clean structure\n",
    "  * Reusability\n",
    "  * Easier navigation in large codebases\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Dependency Injection\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built-in DI container.\n",
    "* Makes it simple to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Swap implementations\n",
    "  * Inject services into controllers\n",
    "  * Write tests with mocks and stubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Flexible HTTP layer\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use **Express (default)** or **Fastify** as the underlying HTTP server.\n",
    "* Easy to integrate with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Existing Express/Fastify middleware.\n",
    "  * Other Node.js libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.5 Inspired by Angular\n",
    "\n",
    "* NestJS **draws inspiration from Angular**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Similar concepts: modules, decorators, dependency injection.\n",
    "  * If you already know Angular, NestJS feels familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.6 Testing support\n",
    "\n",
    "* The framework **encourages Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.\n",
    "* Comes with **built-in support for testing and mocking**.\n",
    "* Makes it easier to build reliable and well-tested applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.7 Strong community & ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "* NestJS has a **growing and active community**.\n",
    "* Provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Extensive documentation**.\n",
    "  * Many **tutorials**.\n",
    "  * Lots of **third-party libraries** and **integrations** to extend capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.8 Microservices-ready\n",
    "\n",
    "* NestJS is well-suited for **microservices architecture**.\n",
    "* Thanks to its:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Modular design.\n",
    "  * Dependency injection.\n",

    "* **Developer-friendly features**.\n",
    "* **Strong community support**.\n",
    "* Can handle **simple apps** to **very complex enterprise systems**.\n",
    "* Embraces **TypeScript, modularity, DI** → helps you build:\n",

    "## 6. Setting Up the NestJS Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working with NestJS, we need to set up a few tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do **three main steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install **Node.js**.\n",
    "2. Install **NestJS CLI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Step 1 – Install Node.js\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the official Node.js website: `https://nodejs.org`.\n",
    "2. Download the **latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version** of Node.js.\n",
    "3. Run the installer and follow the normal installation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need Node.js?\n",
    "\n",
    "* NestJS is built on top of **Node.js**, so we need Node.js to run NestJS apps.\n",
    "* When you install Node.js, it also installs **npm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is npm?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **npm** = Node Package Manager.\n",
    "* It is a **CLI tool** that comes with Node.js.\n",
    "* We use npm to **download and install third-party libraries** from the npm repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check if Node.js is installed\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Command Prompt** (Windows), or\n",
    "  * **Terminal** (macOS / Linux).\n",
    "* Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  node --version\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* If you see an output like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  v18.x.x\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  (or any version) → Node.js is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check npm version\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the same terminal, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  npm --version\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* You should see something like `9.x.x` or another version.\n",
    "* Versions may be **higher or lower** than in the video – that’s fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Step 2 – Install NestJS CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Node.js and npm are installed, we install the **NestJS CLI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NestJS CLI?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CLI = Command Line Interface** tool for NestJS.\n",
    "* It helps you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Create new NestJS projects** easily.\n",
    "  * **Generate boilerplate code** (modules, controllers, services, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install NestJS CLI globally using npm\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run this command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  npm install -g @nestjs/cli\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* `-g` means **install globally**, so you can use it from anywhere on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check if NestJS CLI is installed\n",
    "\n",
    "* After installation finishes, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  nest --version\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* If it prints a version number, the **NestJS CLI is successfully installed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: To run any NestJS CLI command, you start with `nest` followed by the command (e.g. `nest new`, `nest generate`, etc.).\n",
